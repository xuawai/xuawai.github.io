## 2.2.1 Tokenization  
*token* : A token is an instance of a sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing  
*type* : A type is the class of all tokens containing the same character sequence  
*term* : A term is a (perhaps normalized) type that is included in the IR systemâ€™s dictionary  
**e.g.** >sleep perchance to dream  includes 5 tokens,4 types, 3 terms.
